# Color Fatigue Dark Theme

## Overview

The Color Fatigue Dark theme is designed for developers who appreciate a calm, understated aesthetic. Itâ€™s perfect for those late-night coding marathons when you want to maintain focus without overwhelming your senses.

## Key Characteristics

- **Desaturated Colors**: Iâ€™ve intentionally toned down the vibrancy. Expect muted hues that wonâ€™t shout at you from the screen.
- **Low Contrast**: The contrast between foreground and background elements is gentle. No stark white on black here â€” just soothing shades that blend harmoniously.
